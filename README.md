#aboutMe
Hi! I'm a student at the American University of Phnom Penh (AUPP), majoring in Artificial Intelligence.  
I’m passionate about coding, machine learning, problem-solving, and building projects that help me grow as a developer.  
This GitHub is where I practice, experiment, and create — from small exercises to full AI projects.  

Always learning.  
 Always improving.  
 Always building.
